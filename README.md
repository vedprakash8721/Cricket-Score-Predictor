# 🏏 Cricket Score Predictor (ML-based)

A machine learning project that predicts the **final score of an innings** in a cricket match based on the current over and cumulative score. Built with Python and visualized using Streamlit.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how historical ball-by-ball data from IPL matches can be used to train a **regression model** that predicts the final score of an ongoing innings. It leverages :

- Data preprocessing with **Pandas**
- Model building with **Scikit-learn**
- Dashboard UI with **Streamlit**

---

## 📁 Dataset Used

- Dataset: `ipl_2022_deliveries.csv`
- Source: Kaggle (or official IPL data)
- Format: Ball-by-ball breakdown of each innings

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Predict final score given:
  - Current over
  - Cumulative score
- Simple Streamlit UI to test different scenarios
- MAE, RMSE, and R² Score evaluation of model performance
